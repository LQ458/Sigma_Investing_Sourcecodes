# Sigma Investing's WGHS Source Codes

## Project Overview

Sigma Investing is a finance based team that focuses on providing efficient investment solutions using modern decision-making techniques. This repository contains the source code for our TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) based investment decision-making model. The project aims to select the best investment options by comparing various alternatives and measuring their performance relative to the ideal solution.

Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between the operating system or database and the various applications in the project. The following section will cover the required middleware that must be downloaded and installed for the successful execution of this project.

## Required Middleware

1. **Python 3.8** or higher - The TOPSIS implementation is built using Python language. Please ensure to install the appropriate version: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Pandas** - A powerful data manipulation library in Python that makes it easy to work with structured data like CSV, Excel, and SQL databases: `pip install pandas`
3. **Numpy** - A fundamental library for mathematical operations and support for arrays and matrices: `pip install numpy`
4. **Scipy** - A library used for scientific and technical computing: `pip install scipy`
5. **Sklearn** - A library for various machine learning algorithms, performance metrics, and data preprocessing: `pip install scikit-learn`
